## 5. Feature Validation: Estate Pulse Concept

### Price Reveal After Login (Lead Generation)
**Validation: STRONG**

- Gated content converts: "Pricing sheets" and "exclusive floor plans" are recommended high-conversion lead magnets
- Best practice: Show teaser result ("Starting from $X") + gate full pricing behind email
- **2-5% visitor-to-lead conversion** expected with low-friction forms
- Content marketing generates **3x more leads** at **62% less cost** than traditional marketing

**Risk:** Users may bounce if value proposition unclear. Mitigate with:
- Show enough info to establish interest (photos, location, amenities)
- Clear "unlock price" CTA with simple email/phone form
- Instant delivery after signup

### Compare Up to 4 Properties
**Validation: MODERATE-STRONG**

- Comparison tools keep visitors on site longer
- Most platforms limit to 2-3 properties; 4 is a differentiator
- Export/share comparison reports = viral potential
- Key comparison points: Price/sq ft, amenities, location, builder reputation, possession date

**Enhancement Opportunity:**
- Add "share comparison" via WhatsApp/link
- Visual comparison cards for social sharing

### Google Maps Integration
**Validation: STRONG**

- 75% of buyers want digital tools to control more of the process
- Map-first UX differentiates from list-first competitors
- Google Maps API enables:
  - Draw-to-search (circle area to find listings)
  - POI overlays (schools, transit, grocery)
  - Street View integration
- **5% increase in retention, 7% revenue growth** with geospatial features

**Key Feature:** Let users search by drawing on map, not just filters

### WhatsApp Notifications
**Validation: VERY STRONG (especially for India)**

- WhatsApp = dominant messaging platform in India
- **98% open rates** vs 20% for email
- Automated features available:
  - New listing alerts
  - Price change notifications
  - Appointment scheduling
  - Project launch broadcasts
- Integration via WhatsApp Business API is mature

**Implementation:**
- Opt-in at signup ("Get WhatsApp alerts for new projects")
- Segment by: Location preference, budget range, possession timeline
- Send: New listings, price drops, site visit reminders
