# Interview: Livelihood & Buddhism for a Broken Brain

Date: 2026-01-19

## Context

Software engineer who quit 6 months ago due to depression. Now practicing Buddhism seriously (Zen/Dzogchen leaning). Has ADHD which makes structure difficult. 3 months financial runway, needs ~$1000/month. Wants meaningful work aligned with Right Livelihood — no harm, no addictive behaviors, helps people wake up.

Decided: **Solo venture in mental health content, not joining workforce.** Willing to try and fail for 3-6 months.

## Key Decisions

- **Path:** Content + community play, not an app. Writing as the foundation.
- **Niche:** Buddhism + mental health + ADHD — "waking up with a broken brain"
- **Framing:** Buddhism for broken people. Meditation that doesn't bypass real pain. ADHD-friendly practice.
- **Platforms:** Medium + Twitter/X for discovery, eventually own newsletter
- **Bridge income:** Freelance work in parallel (sparse but ongoing)
- **Structure for ADHD:** AI-assisted systems, accountability with close friends, trackable short-term goals

## Identified Risks / Weak Spots

- **Fear of judgment** — has insights but doubts their value. Risk of never shipping.
- **ADHD + solo entrepreneurship** — playing on hard mode. No external structure by default.
- **No network** — can't tap warm referrals for freelance, no built-in audience for content
- **3 months runway vs 6 month experiment** — math is tight, freelance bridge is critical
- **"Anti-convenience" framing** — hard sell. Must reframe as "depth over distraction"
- **Remote work ≠ good culture** — isolated building can worsen depression if no community forms

## Open Questions

- First 10 readers: who specifically would he message to read his first post?
- Accountability structure: which friends, what cadence, what check-ins?
- Freelance pipeline: any former colleagues worth reaching out to despite discomfort?
- What's the minimum Buddhist/meditation "credential" needed, if any, to be taken seriously?

## Next Steps

- [ ] **Week 1:** Write and publish first piece on Medium. Topic: intersection of ADHD and meditation practice — what actually works vs. what's prescribed. Ship ugly.
- [ ] **Week 1:** Set up accountability system — pick 2-3 friends, define weekly check-in format, share this plan with them
- [ ] **Week 2:** Create Twitter account if not exists. Start threading insights from Buddhist practice + ADHD lived experience. One thread, 5-7 tweets.
- [ ] **Week 2:** Reach out to 5 people (any people) who might resonate, share first Medium piece, ask for honest feedback
- [ ] **Month 1:** Publish 4 pieces minimum. Quantity over quality. Build the muscle.
- [ ] **Ongoing:** Freelance outreach — even uncomfortable asks to old contacts. Bridge income is non-negotiable.
- [ ] **Month 2:** Evaluate: any traction? Any resonance? Double down or pivot framing.
